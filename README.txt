This Java Application can recursively rename files with simple rules or with regex rules. Very slim, no install&uninstall - just download and run (and delete file, if you do not like it anymore).
Tested on Ubuntu & Windows.

Not guarantee that it works!

Have not been working on this for a while.


_TODOS:_
-Implement functions:
	-Simulate
	-Case-Insensitive Rules/Regex
	-Regex Builder
	-Regex direct Help
-Improve:
	-In Linux you have to click twice on "Help", "Info", "Check for updates"
	-The filter are saved in the home folder
		Though these files are VERY small, this is not nice
		(these are not automatically removed, when the .jar is deleted).
	-mark regex-Rules in the overview
